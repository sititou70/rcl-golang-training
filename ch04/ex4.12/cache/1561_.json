{"Num":1561,"Title":"Water Phase Diagram","Transcript":"[[A phase diagram of water, with temperature on the horizontal axis increasing to the left, and pressure on the vertical axis increasing downwards.  It shows the commonly known phases of water (ice, liquid, vapor) as well as the more exotic high-pressure phases Ice II, Ice III and Ice V.  As pressure increases, the diagram shows Vanilla Ice (Ice VI) transitioning to David Bowie \u0026 Queen.]]\n\n{{Title text: Vanilla Ice was produced in small quantities for years, but it wasn't until the 90s that experimenters collaborated to produce a sample that could survive at room temperature for several months. }}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/water_phase_diagram.png"}
