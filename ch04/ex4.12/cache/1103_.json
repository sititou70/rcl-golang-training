You are not forgotten.\nEver since I heard the simile \"as neglected as the nine button on the microwave,\" I've found myself adjusting cook times.\n\n{{Title text: FYI: If you get curious and start trying to calculate the time adjustment function that minimizes the gap between the most-used and least-used digit (for a representative sample of common cook times) without without altering any time by more than 10%, and someone asks you what you're doing, it's easier to just lie.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nine.png"}
