{"Num":986,"Title":"Drinking Fountains","Transcript":"[[Person leaving the bathroom, headed towards a nearby water fountain.  Person having a drink at said water fountain.  Person grumblingly reentering the bathroom. Same person leaving the bathroom.  Cycle repeats endlessly in a horrific sisyphean loop.]]\n\nI avoid drinking fountains outside bathrooms because I'm afraid of getting trapped in a loop.\n\n{{Title text: I've always wondered whether you could drink slowly enough, and eliminate fast enough, that you just sort of peed continuously. But I'm afraid to try because I worry someone might call while I'm doing it and ask what I'm up to, and I won't be able to think of a lie.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/drinking_fountains.png"}
