{"Num":1404,"Title":"Quantum Vacuum Virtual Plasma","Transcript":"[[Two figures are walking along, chatting.]]\nFigure: Hear about that \"impossible\" microwave thruster? \n\n[[The figures stop walking and look at each other.]]\nWoman: Yeah. Let me get this straight - they pumped 20 kilowatts into a box under ambient conditions... and it only twitched a *little*?\nFigure: Yeah. \n\n[[The figures continue walking. We see them in silhouette.]]\nWoman: *That's* surprising. If you umped 20 kilowatts into *me*, I'd twitch a *lot*. \nFigure: But you're not pushing on the quantum vacuum.\nWoman: I *might* be. I do a lot of things. \nFigure: I guess we can't be sure. \n\n{{Title text: I don't understand the things you do, and you therefore may represent an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/quantum_vacuum_virtual_plasma.png"}
