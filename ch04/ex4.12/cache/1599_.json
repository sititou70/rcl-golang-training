{"Num":1599,"Title":"Water Delivery","Transcript":"Now that Amazon is advertising one-hour delivery of bottled water,\n\n[[A diagram showing the most obvious progression of events.  First just one bottle is sent from the warehouse to a person.  Then two.  Then five.  Then 20.\nFinally, a direct pipe sends the water along.]]\n\nI vote we start calling municipal plumbing \"on-demand hyperloop-style water delivery\" and see if we can sell anyone on the idea.\n\n{{Title text: When I was a kid, I asked my parents why our houses didn't have toothpaste pipes in addition to water ones. I'm strangely pleased to see Amazon thinking the same way.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/water_delivery.png"}
