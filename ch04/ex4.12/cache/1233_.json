{"Num":1233,"Title":"Relativity","Transcript":"[[We see a head and shoulders view of Einstein. He looks ponderous.]]\n((Einstein's \"line\" is in a thought bubble.))\nEinstein: If I were traveling at the speed of light, my butt would look *awesome*.\nEinstein was famed for his Gedankedank.\n\n{{Title text: It's commonly believed that Lorentz contraction makes objects appear flatter along the direction of travel. However, this ignores light travel times. In fact, a fast-moving butt would appear rotated toward the observer but not substantially distorted. Shakira was right.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/relativity.png"}
