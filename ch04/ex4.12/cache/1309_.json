Another figure is standing behind her.]]\nFigure: Why are you turning the pages like that? \nWoman: If I touch the wrong thing, I'll lose my place and have to start over.\nIf books worked like infinite-scrolling webpages\n\n{{Title text: Maybe we should give up on the whole idea of a 'back' button.
