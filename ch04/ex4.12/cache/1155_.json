OK, starting from your driveway, take every left that doesn't put you on a prime-numbered highway or street named for a president. \nWhen people ask for step-by-step directions, I worry that there will be too many steps to remember, so I try to put them in minimal form. \n\n{{Title text: People get really grumpy when they realize you're giving them directions for how to go to the store and buy a GPS.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/kolmogorov_directions.png"}
