Person 1 flips through a number of them]]\nPerson 1: All your books are full of blank pages.\nPerson 2: Not true. That one has some ink on page 78.\n[[Person 1 looks at page 78]]\nPerson 1: A smudge.\nPerson 2: So?\n\nPerson 1: There are no words. You're not reading. There's no *story* there.\nPerson 2: Maybe not for you. When I look at those books, I think about all *kinds* of stories.\n\nPerson 2: Reading is about more than what's on the page. Holding a book prompts my mind to enrich itself.  Frankly, I suspect the book isn't even necessary.\n\nPerson 2: The whole industry is evil. Greedy publishers and rich authors try to convince us our brains *need* their words. But I refuse to be a sucker.\nPerson 1: Who sold you all these blank books?\n\n{{Title text: I just noticed CVS has started stocking homeopathic pills on the same shelves with--and labeled similarly to--their actual medicine. Telling someone who trusts you that you're giving them medicine, when you know youâre not, because you want their money, isnât just lying--itâs like an example youâd make up if you had to illustrate for a child why lying is wrong.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/alternative_literature.png"}
