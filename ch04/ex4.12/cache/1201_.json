{"Num":1201,"Title":"Integration by Parts","Transcript":"A guide to integration by parts: \nGiven a problem of the form:\nâ«f(x)g(x)dx = ? \nChoose variables u and v such that: \nu = f(x)\ndv = g(x)dx\nNow the original expression becomes:\nâ«udv = ? \nWhich \ndefinitely\n looks easier. \nAnyway, I gotta run. \nBut good luck!\n\n{{Title text: If you can manage to choose u and v such that u = v = x, then the answer is just (1\n2)x^2, which is easy to remember. Oh, and add a '+C' or you'll get yelled at.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/integration_by_parts.png"}
