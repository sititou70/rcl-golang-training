{"Num":793,"Title":"Physicists","Transcript":"A man stands at a blackboard covered in equations and diagrams, an open laptop and scattered paper at his feet. His fists are balled in anger and there is a little angry squiggle over his head. A second man stands behind him, arms out in a shrug.\n((Words in \u003c\u003e are gray.))\nSecond man: You're trying to predict the behavior of \u003ccomplicated system\u003e? Just model it as a \u003csimple object\u003e, and then add some secondary terms to account for \u003ccomplications I just thought of\u003e. -- Easy, right? -- So, why does \u003cyour field\u003e need a whole journal, anyway?\nLiberal-arts majors may be annoying sometimes, but there's \nnothing\n more obnoxious than a physicist first encountering a new subject.\n\n{{Title text: If you need some help with the math, let me know, but that should be enough to get you started! Huh? No, I don't need to read your thesis, I can imagine roughly what it says.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/physicists.png"}
