{"Num":1252,"Title":"Increased Risk","Transcript":"[[Three figures are standing around. Two have beach towels. A woman is looking at her cell phone. One of them is beret guy.]]\nWoman: We should go to the north beach. Someone said the south beach has a 20% higher risk of shark attacks. \nMan: Yeah, but statistically, taking three beach trips instead of two increases our odds of getting shot by a swimming dog carrying a handgun in its mouth by 50%! \nBeret guy: Oh no! This is our third trip! \nReminder: A 50% increase in a tiny risk is still tiny. \n\n{{Title text: You may point out that strictly speaking, you can use that statement to prove that all risks are tiny--to which I reply HOLY SHIT WATCH OUT FOR THAT DOG!}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/increased_risk.png"}
