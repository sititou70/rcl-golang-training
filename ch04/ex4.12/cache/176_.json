{"Num":176,"Title":"Before Sunrise","Transcript":"[[Man stands in frame, talking]]\nMan: Every morning for a week now I've gone out driving before sunrise.\nI wanted to get lost in the dark, park my car, listen to music, and sip from a warm drink as dawn broke around me, gradually revealing a landscape I'd never before seen.  A chain of unique beinnings forcing wonder into the seeds of each day.\nBut I guess I need more willpower, because each sunrise just found me at your mom's apartment again.\n{{title text: It's an amazing time of day; the light is great for photography.}}","Img":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/before_sunrise.png"}
